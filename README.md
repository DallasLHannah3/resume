 # Hello There!
This is the beginning of my GitHub and IT Purple-teaming career! Let's go!

# About Me
I am Dallas Hannah. I am a extremely motivated, self-starter, self-taught, leader and cybersecurity enthusiast. 

In 2006 I was hired by NASA to be a vehicle mechanic. Due to some personal issues, I had to leave the position 4 days into the job. In 2007 I started a job as a small aircraft mechanic, shortly after I began my career as a Heavy Diesel Mechanic with Travel Centers of America.
There I learned how to perform perventative maintenance and bumper to bumper mechanical and electronic systems. I dove in, with my unmatched drive and thrist for knowledge and quickly became the lead technician with 4 ASE certifications, Level IV Tire tech (highest level) by the Tire Industry Association, as well as my MAC 608/609 refrigerant license.

In 2012 I left TA Travel Centers to be a lead mechanic, service writer, parts person, and fuel attendant, for Salem Nationalease in Orlando, FL. After 3 years I had reduced the outside repair costs and tow bills by $300k/year by teaching myself how the aftertreatment systems (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, Selective Calatyst Reduction system, and Diesel Emissions Fluid (DEF)) pneumatic electromechanical control systems. 

In 2015 Salem Nationalease moved me to Dalton, GA to be a site manager. In this role I was not only a lead diagnostic techician, I also trained and managed 20 mechanics, 2 administrators, 1 executive sales person, and 4 shop staff/transportation employees. 
Our operation spanned 4 shifts working 24/7/364 to oversee all aspects of fleet, property maintenance, admin/clerical, and outside corporate executive sales. 

My top customers were:
Shaw Carpets - 50 power units, 500 trailers
Mohawk Carpets - 150 power units, 300 trailers
Beaulieu Carpet and Flooring - 30 power units, 4 yard jockeys, and over 100 trailers
Engineered Floors - 10 power units and approximately 50 trailers

I developed, monitored, and aggregated data from electronic control modules and driver logging systems (PeopleNet, Fleetio, GeoTab) to provide c-suite executives stunning visual data graphs to show the cost impact per vehicle and the variations between areodynamics, engine and performance modifications (performed via J1939 canbus protocol), in an effort to reduce operation and maintenance costs for the power units and trailers for the world's four largets flooring manufacturers. 

In 2016 I was dubbed the "unofficial" area/regional manager for across four shops from Dalton, GA to Chattanooga, TN. I trained the other site managers, audited their inventories to get it to true zero/actual count numbers. I worked with consignment vendors to streamline each shops on hand parts, from tires to air filters, engines, transmissions, and any supporting parts or equipment to perform full frame up repairs on wrecked and burned trucks to get them back to road worhty and DOT compliance.  

By 2018 I was overseeing 300+ heavy duty power units and 1,000+ box trailers, box trucks, dollys, forklifts, yard jockeys (yard dogs), and all their light/medium duty equipment.

I was in daily contact with C-Suite employees regarding the repair status, cost savings analysis, and warranty submission and fund recovery. I attended multiple weekly meetings with Mohawk Carpet executives to roll out their newly purchased fleet or 2018 International and Freightliner chassis'. 

From there I accepted a position as a maintenance and fleet mananger for the worlds largest premier waste collection service provider, Waste Connections. 

Here I learned truly honed my leadership skills and got hands on with monthly, quarterly, and annual corporate budget reviews, P&Ls, day to day and year over year operating costs tracking and improvements. I reduced on hand inventory by over $25k by working with vendors to buy back parts that had been sitting on the shelf for over 15 years. I was able to work with corporate account executives to get credit back on parts that hand been purchased more than a decade ago.

From here I decided to follow my passion and pursue my dream career in cybersecurity. I left Waste Connections and accepted a role as a Jr. DevSecOps Engineer. 

During my time at FormFree I was able to greatly reduce our cloud infrastructure costs 

# About me

I have over 20 years of experience as a heavy diesel mechanic, after treatment/emissions diagnostic technician. I worked my way from lube tech in 2007 into an manager role in 2015, by 2016 I was working as an assistant regional manager support my regional manager and managing 4 shops total across N. Georgia and SE Tennessee. With over 40 employees working 24/7/364 shifts, I am comfortable troubleshooting remotely over the phone and rubbing elbows with the C-level executives with the largest flooring manufacturing companies in the world including, but not limited to, Shaw carpets, Mohawk Carpets, Beaulieu, and Engineered Flooring. 

With my experience at FormFree, Informative Research (Acquisition), and Stewart Title (Merger), I have developed a very solid foundation in purple teaming and cloud security. I have extensive experience with man popular network and web application/API pentetration testing tools and creating reports to share with C-level executives to show the current security position of their internal networks, web servers, virtualization and container management systems, and web applications. 

I also performed many successful phishing campaigns in which I was able to phish our own CTO and get a full account compromise with his M365/Azure account. Against my discretion, he had full global administrator access and I gained access to his account with a carefully crafted spear-phishing email.  

Not only can I build the environment, secure it, protect it, test it, report on the findings and deliver the information to C-suite executives in a way that they understand. I don't get lost in the weeds with the technical details, I am clear, to the point, and can use analogies like a boss. 

I can do any job, I can sell anything, and I can win anyone over. Give me a chance and I will not disappoint.
